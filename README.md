# Summary

The code was cleaned and formatted.

Semantic HTML tags replaced existing divs.

Navigation bar goes to their contents.

Cover image was moved from the background to the front.

> Weird 4px difference when I did this.
margin-botton: 25px -> 21px to make up for it.

alt attributes were given to images.

Organized CSS and redundant tags were compiled together.

Deleted classes and made the CSS reference semantic tags instead.

> I'm not sure if its better to leave classes alone in case content is added in the future.

Added comments to find things easier.
